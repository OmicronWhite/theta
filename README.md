## Building
### Windows
If you're on Windows, building Theta is really easy!  
Just clone the repo or [download it as a zip](https://github.com/PlusGit/theta/archive/master.zip), then run `build.bat` or `build_from-zip.bat` respectvely.
Tools will run in 64-bit if they can, if you don't want them to then just run `build.bat /FORCEWIN32`.
### Linux
It's slightly more complicated on Linux:

####Install needed packages
__Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint/etc__
```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ p7zip-full git
```
__Arch Linux__
```bash
sudo pacman -S gcc p7zip git
```
####Initialise your enviroment  
`cd` to where you cloned theta, and then:
```bash
utilities/linux/initenv.sh
```
to prepare your enviroment.

Then, you can just run `./build.sh` in your Theta root directory (use `-n` option to build without a version).
